# Who was my target audience?

One of my target audiences was individuals who were interested in seeing how entertainment content viewership has morphed 
over time. Today, because such a great deal of content is published online, analyzing different aspects about this topic and 
recognizing factors that may have contributed to this change (through effective visualizations) would be 
interesting for this audience. 

Moreover, because so many individuals are on the edge of converting from cable or satellite TV to subscribing onto an online
platform (such as Netflix, Hulu,etc), I wanted to generate an comprehensive analysis that allowed these people on the fence to 
better make their decision. Therefore, my project can appeal to two audience groups. The first are individuals who are 
fascinated in seeing how content viewership has changed over the years. The second are individuals who are on the fence of
converting from cable or satellite to online streaming platforms.

# Summary of my work so far/ My process

One of the initial challenges I ran into when creating this project was the order of the visualizations. To elaborate, the order was not very clear, and didn’t properly convey the over-arching message of the story. Consequently, I changed the order of my storyboard by breaking it up into two larger sections: background and factors. The background describes statistics related to historical data, while the factors gives insight into why people are switching and why someone on the fence might want to. 

My first phase of the process involved four visualizations: three background-related and one factor-related. However, I came to realize that I needed more factor-related content in my story. Therefore, I decided to add, what I thought, was a factor-related visualization. This was a graphic that demonstrated the number of internet users since 2007 (when Netflix launched streaming). However, after part 2, I realized that this was not a factor why people should switch. Rather, it is more of a background-related visualization, that provides another possible explanation as to why (potentially) subscription to streaming platforms has increased dramatically over the years.

Additionally, decided to add stronger “call-to-action” to my story. Therefore, I added a factor—a visualization describing the number of people who watch entertainment content on their TV vs. those who watch on other devices (e.g. cell phones, tablets, etc.). Consequently, my final story comprised of six visualizations: four which were background-related (a general overview, age-stratification analysis, a Netflix vs. Dish TV subscriber count analysis over time, and a visualization of Internet users worldwide over time) and two of which were factor-related (a price comparison of streaming platforms vs. live TV platforms and comparison of those who watch entertainment on their TV vs. those who watch on other devices). In the process, I changed many of the visualizations, such as modifying a pie-chart to bar chart, or a grouped bar-chart to a line graph with two sets of data. In the end, I believe my data story effectively describes how over time, content viewership has moved more towards streaming platforms and can help an individual on the fence about switching from cable/satellite to a streaming platform.
