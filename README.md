This is my portfolio for Telling Stories With Data

# About Me
Hello! I am currently a Master of Information Systems Student at Carnegie Mellon University. My pronouns are he/him/his. I am originally from Phoenix, Arizona and went to ASU for my undergraduate studies. I took mostly computer-science or advanced mathematics classes at ASU, and therefore decided to join the MISM program here at CMU. For fun, I enjoy hiking and finding new places to eat around my area! I am also an avid Netflix watcher and the biggest fan of "The Office"!

# What I hope to learn
I have always been intrigued in demonstrating trends and patterns utilizing large sets of data. However, doing this in an aesthetic, efficient manner has been difficult for me. To elaborate, I tend to either add to much to my visualizations or too little. I want to be able to support my ideas and thoughts with meaningful, concise graphic visuals to paint a useful picture for my audience! Furthermore, I plan to go into the field of consulting, in which describing data through charts, graphs, and other graphics plays a key role in helping clients solve problems. This class will provide me a toolbox to leverage when creating these presentation visualizations. Lastly, although I have never worked with Tableu in the past, I know how useful of a software it is! Therefore, I am very much looking forward to delving into that tool and becoming better at Telling Stories with Data!
